By using Nortantis, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

1. Nortantis is provided as free software, and we (the developer(s)) try to assure it works well, but in the event that it doesn't, we are not responsible for any harm done. If excessive use of this software contributes to global warming and kills a polar bear, you cannot sue us for it.

2. There are no license requirements/restrictions or attribution requirements for maps generated by Nortantis. However, if you choose to use Nortantis's ability to use user-supplied images, then it is up to you to respect any copyright or license associated with those images.

3. Nortantis randomly generates maps. As such, it is, in rare cases, capable of producing offensive content. In such cases, we, the developers of Nortantis, are not responsible for its actions. If your fantasy map offends you, we recommend you square your shoulders and suck it up.
