By using Nortantis, you agree to the following additional terms and conditions:

1. There are no license requirements/restrictions or attribution requirements for maps generated by Nortantis. However, if you choose to use Nortantis's ability to use user-supplied images to use images not distributed with Nortantis, then it is up to you to respect any copyright or license associated with those images.

2. Nortantis randomly generates maps. As such, it is, in rare cases, capable of producing offensive content. In such cases, we, the developers of Nortantis, are not responsible for its actions. If your fantasy map offends you, we recommend you square your shoulders and suck it up.

We hope that you enjoy using this software.
