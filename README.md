# nortantis
Nortantis is a fantasy map generator and editor originally created as an academic project. It uses a simple tectonic plate simulation to create islands and continents with trees, rivers, and mountains. The result has the appearance of an old-fashioned hand-drawn map.

For more information and examples of generated maps, see the project page <a href="https://jandjheydorn.com/nortantis">here</a>.
